# Reflection by Alex Korzeniwsky

This Lab has pushed my use and understanding of the String commands, and random number generator. I am leaving this lab with a greater understanding of the different components needed to utilize the random number generator 'java.util.Random', and the string commands such as the string builder 'StringBuilder'. Starting this lab by drawing information from a files was failure and gave me good practice with the
'dnaInputsFile = new File("input/dna_inputs.txt");
scanner = new Scanner(dnaInputsFile);
} catch (FileNotFoundException noFile)'
line of command. I used the 'scanner' tool to fetch the information from the document

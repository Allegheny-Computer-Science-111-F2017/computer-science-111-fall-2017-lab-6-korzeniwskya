# Reflection by Alex Korzeniwsky

This Lab has pushed my use and understanding of the String commands, and random
number generator. I am leaving this lab with a greater understanding of the
different components needed to utilize the random number generator
'java.util.Random', and the string commands such as the string builder
'StringBuilder'. Starting this lab by drawing information from a files was
failure and gave me good practice with the importing from a file. I explored a
new segment of Strings with string builder and did a bit of research on how to
implement these new string builders in my application to manipulate my strings.
I used string builders to make random deletions and random insertions. I got
practice in using sub strings in conjunction with random numbers to generate
new strings. I had problems with my randomization where I was not able to apply
my random number to the corresponding Char in a string. After consulting with
peers I found I was not using the random number in the correct parameter.
Overall I gained a great deal of experience with the scanner tool, random
number generator, string manipulation, and a new form of string builders.
